# Lab D: Verilog Modeling and FPGA Implementation of 4-Bit Comparator
An n-bit comparator compares two unsigned binary numbers and returns the outputs whether the first number is greater than, equal to, or less than the second number. In this labwe derived, implemented, and verifiedthe functionality of a2-bit comparatorcircuitin HDL. Building upon that, the 2-bit comparator designed wasinstantiated twice to create a 4-bit comparator. The 4-bit input wassplit with each 2-bit comparator handling the 2 most significant and 2 least significant bits. Lastly, the lab exploredmanually deriving the Boolean expressions for lighting up each individual segment of a 7 segment display. With 4 switches, we implemented our design to display the binary equivalent, decimal values between 0 and 9 on the segment display of target board.
