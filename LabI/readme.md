# Lab I â€“Extremely Simple Computer (ESC)
In thislab we explore the fundamentalfunctions of a central processing unit(CPU). To keep the demonstration extremely simple, the CPU is only capable of 3 instructions: load, add,and store. While the design of the CPU in Verilog is givenin the lab manual, the laboratory aims to demonstrate how the ESCworks and gain a deeperappreciationtohow data moves and is modified within the system and memory registers. The design source from the lab manual will be re-created and simulated to verify its functionality. In addition, the program.mem file is modified so the CPU adds the 6 middle digits of our student ID and stores the accumulated value in memory.
