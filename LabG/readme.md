# Lab G: HEX Counter Design on FPGA Board
n this laboratory, the onboard crystal oscillator of the NexysA7 development board will be utilized to generate clock signals of varying frequencies. This will be significant for applications that are timing sensitive. Moreover, it allows a digital circuitâ€™s function to be synchronized to real-time requirements in the physical world. In the first and second exercises, the function of a counter will be demonstrated and how different clock frequencies can be generated using a counter. Next, for a given clockfrequency, the 7 segment display will be used to cycle and display hexadecimal values 0 through f. Lastly, in the third exercise, both the counter and 7 segment display will be combined to create a controllable counter. Applying 2 switch inputs, differentclock frequencies will be selected resulting in the 7 segment display to cycle through hexadecimal values at various speeds.
