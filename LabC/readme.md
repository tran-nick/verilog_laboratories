# Lab C: Synthesis, Implementation, Timing Simulation, and Demonstration on FPGA Board
Building on designs from previous experiments, this lab explores how to use Vivado Design Suite for timing simulations, synthesis, and implementation of HDL designs onto the Xilinx Nexys A7 FPGA development board. Timing simulations are necessary to verify that the design will behave as expected on a physical device.Due to deviations in real world behavior of circuits such as delays, running timing simulations provide importantfeedback toensuringa design’s behavior,such as how long it takes an LED to turn on. The next step synthesis, is the process of converting the HDL written design into an actual representation that can bebuilt using gates of the FPGA. Lastly, through implementation, the program chooseswhich gates and how they are interconnected in the FPGA chip specified by our design synthesis. By programming the code or “bitstream” of our design onto the board, we can physically realize or “write” our circuits to the FPGA.
