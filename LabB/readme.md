# Lab B: Verilog Modeling and Simulation Using Vivado
Dataflow modeling enables logic circuits to be described by how the input flows through a system based on Boolean expressions. This lab explores entering designs as Boolean expressions using Verilog HDL. The Boolean expressions will be generated from the problem statement and optimized to a minimum sum of products using Karnaugh maps.Furthermore, the lab will build further uponpreviously enteredmodules of a 1-bit full adder to design a 4-bit ripple adder. Simulations of the hierarchical 4-bit ripple adder model will be compared against an equivalent behavioral model to contrast difference in functionality.
