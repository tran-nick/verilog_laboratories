# LAB A: Design Entry and Simulation Using Vivado
Rather than building physical circuits to study, modern engineers are able to use hardware descriptive language (HDL) to programmatically model and simulate the behavior of electronic circuits. Vivado by Xilinx is a software application for the creation and analysis of HDL designs. This experiment explores how to establish a new design project using Vivado and how to enter basic designs usingthe Integrated Design Environment (IDE)targeting a Nexys A7 50T development board. Entered designs will be used to synthesizelogicschematics and simulated to verify the entered design matches expected output behavior.
