# Final Project for Digital Logic Design Course
In this project, we will expand on the previous laboratory exercise and build another“simple” processor.Like the extremely simple computer (ESC), the processor requires a controller/control unit that defines the system’s operations per clock cycle. In the processor, the control unit coordinates which registers output onto the multiplexer bus and which register is being written to.In contrast to the ESC, the simple processor is able to receive input from the user defined 16-bit DIN input. In addition, the simple processor has registers which can be written to/read fromvia themultiplexer that controls the data transfer between interconnected elements ofthe processor. Furthermore, where the ESC could only perform addition, the processor is capable of addition and subtraction through an adder/subtracter unit. Results from the adder/subtracter unit can then be output on the multiplexer to be written into one of the various registers available.
