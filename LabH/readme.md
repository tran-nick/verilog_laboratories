# Lab H: Aggregate 7-segment Display Controller
In this laboratory, we explore how to utilize the 8-digit, 7-segment display to display different, unique numbers. From previous labs, it was demonstrated that because each 4-digit, 7-segment display shared common cathodes, all 4 digits of the same displayshowed the same value. However, building upon Lab G, the onboard oscillator and clock division may be utilized to effectively make each digit of the 7-segment display appear to be different values. In part 1 of this experiment, all 8 digits of the 7-segment display will be used to create a counter able to display numbers from 0 to 99,999,999. This is achieved by cycling through each digit display, turning it on and off faster than the user can perceive, so it appears that all of the display is turned on and each digit is unique.  Similarly, in part 2 the 7-segment display will be used to display the word “HELLO”, in ticker tape fashion. Meaning visually, the letters “HELLO” are able to scroll across the 8 digits of the display from right to left in a repeated pattern.
