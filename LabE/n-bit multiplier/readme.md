# Lab E: Verilog Modeling and FPGA Implementation of Wallace Array Multipliers
Previously, n-bit ripple adders were explored to demonstrate binary addition on multiple bit numbers. In this laboratory,an array multiplier will be modeled using Verilog HDL to perform binary multiplication on multiple bit numbers.Unlike addition which typicallyyieldsthesame bit-width sum, binary multiplication result in a larger bit width productcompared to the inputs. For example, a 3-bit number multiplied with another 3-bit number yields a 6-bit wide binary product.Following the demonstration of a 3x3 array multiplier, we will extend the array to implement a 4x4 multiplier.
